## 502: End-to-End Testing ##

### Introduction ###
Finally we can put everything together by doing a test run end-to-end, monitor to track how message flow across systems, device and components.

### About the Exercise Today ###
In this exercise, we will:
- Test run the loyalty management application and 'Cafe Supremo' mobile app as per roles of marketing manager and end customer respectively
- Identify and monitor message flow across components used in all lab exercises today

### Prerequisites ###
+ Completion of previous lab exercise: [501: Update Source Code for Sending Push Notification from JEE Application to Mobile Cloud Service](501-PuttingAllTogetherLab.md)

#### Create An Offer from Loyalty Management Application ####

1. Go to home page of the Loyalty Management application. The Loyalty Management application URL should be in the format of:  
`https://**<JCS WLS instance IP Adress>**/loyalty/jsp/welcome.jsp`  
Provide an integer value for **Input Offer Criteria**, enter `10000` in this example representing any customer who has 10000 points or above to match offer criteria.  
Select a **Target Product**, `Festival Blend` is chosen in this example.

**What has just happened?**    
On previous lab: [501: Update Source Code for Sending Push Notification from JEE Application to Mobile Cloud Service](501-PuttingAllTogetherLab.md), we modified some code in *confirm.jsp* under loyalty management JEE application leveraging Developer and Java Cloud Service, such that the application can call Mobile Cloud Service push notification REST API, followed by MCS exchanging with Google Firebase to deliver the push notification towards the registered Android device.

**What has just happened?**    
On early integration lab: [3. Rapid Connect Applications by Oracle Integration Cloud Service](../Integrations/README.md), we have setup an integration flow which wired up a CRM customer activity log SOAP API and exposed as REST API on the Integration Cloud Service, allowing mobile user action can be logged and process offer result.

**What has just happened?**    
On early [Microservice Lab](../Microservices/README.md), we have deployed 2 microservices - Offer and QR respectively leveraging Developer and Application Container Cloud Service. Upon 'Accept' offer by customer, the result offer detail and QR image will be displayed on mobile device.
