## 100: Create Database Connectivity for Loyalty Management Application [TBD] ##

### Introduction ###
This tutorial demonstrates how to:
- Create Loyalty Management Database Connectivity on WebLogic Server in which associated tables will be used by a JEE Application later.

### Prerequisites ###
- Oracle Public Cloud Service account including Developer Cloud Service and Java Cloud Service (Check with instructor if you don't have one)
- [Loyalty Management Database connectivity for WebLogic Server instance in Java Cloud Serivce](100-JavaAppsLab.md)

#### Create Database Connectivity on WebLogic Server ####

1. [Sign in](sign.in.to.oracle.cloud.md) to [https://cloud.oracle.com/sign-in](https://cloud.oracle.com/sign-in) by provided **Java Cloud Service \(JCS\)** identity domain Id and credential in the Access Document. Using the dashboard open the Java Cloud Service Console.

3. A new browser opens and you are redirected to the selected consoleâ€™s log-in page. If the server is protected with a self-signed certificate, you will be warned that this certificate is not trusted. This is the default configuration and you can configure your certification. Select I Understand the Risk, and Add Exception (accept certificate).

+ **Database Name**: `PDB1.<Your Identity Domain>.oraclecloud.internal`
+ **Host Name**: the Database Cloud Service to run the application, i.e. `apacctddb.compute-<Your Identity Domain>.oraclecloud.internal` or `(Provided by instructor)`
+ **Port**: leave the default 1521
+ **Database User Name**: loyalty
+ **Password**: Database User 'loyalty' password, i.e. `Welcome_1` or `(Provided by intructor)`
+ **oracle.jdbc.DRCPConnectionClass**: leave empty

12. Click Next.
